========

Hey there everyone, I'm Michael, and welcome to my new hacking game. This is a Phase 3 in-development build of Red Team. Before I let you play the game, there are a few things I want to say - so please read this carefully before submitting bug reports or asking certain questions.

First and foremost, I want to thank you for deciding to check this build out. I'm only one programmer and I'm ssill a student. Game development isn't easy and there's a reason there are post-secondary courses for it. Red Team is an &bincredibly&B large project for someone like me and it means &b&ia lot&B&I to me that you have decided it is worth checking out. Your feedback and criticism is valued deeply.

Secondly, I'd like to thank the following people for helping me with the game and various challenges I've faced (Discord usernames used in cases where I don't know their real name or they would not be comfortable having it displayed).

 - &bDeclan Hoare&B                         - &wfor advising me on how to do basic audio processing for the glitch effect in the thundershock intro&W
 - &bJohn Tur&B                             - &wfor giving me better ideas of faster/more secure APIs to use in .NET Core&W
 - &bViperidae Fractures Status Quo&B       - &wfor giving insights on real-life hacking tools and Linux shell commands, on which Red Team's in-game commands/programs are loosely based, or of which I have created renditions of.&W
 - &bJames Dupuis&B                         - &wfor being a mentor and an &bawesome&B gamedev professor&W
 - &bMatt Trobbiani&B                       - for inspiring me to do this, thanks to Hacknet.
 

This is not the final game and so there are a lot of features missing. However, the core gameplay is here and I have created a demo op for you to complete after creating your Agent. It will teach you the core mechanics of the game and give you an idea of what's to come. I hope you enjoy what you play.
