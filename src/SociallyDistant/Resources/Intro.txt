Welcome to RED TEAM, my in-development hacking game. If you're reading this then chances are things are working properly and the game's started up. That's awesome! First, I wanna thank you for taking the time to try out a development build of a game that's NOWHERE NEAR finished, just because you think it's cool. That really means a lot to me and your feedback/criticism is very much valued.  This is an early version of the game though (specifically, a Dev Phase 3 build) and so not every feature is working, and indeed some features may not work as I intend them to.

Here's what's working:
    - Command shell (redsh)
    - In-game file system
    - Command tab-completion
    - Various linux-y commands (type &bhelp&B for a list of commands.)
    - Neofetch
    - Internet Simulation and Network Address Traversal (NAT) emulation for the hacking mechanic.
    - The Hops mechanic (connecting to a device in your network will be a lot faster than connecting to one in a completely different region of the in-game world, for example).
    - Thundershock Engine's post-processor
    - Configuration System
    - Resolution Independence (things take up the same physical amount of space regardless of your screen size, of course, unless the aspect ratio is different)

And here's what's not. Yet.
    - GUI System
    - Save System
    - /bin Folder
    - Nmap scanning
    - Hacking system
    - Contracts (missions)
    - E-mail
    - Chat System (the one from The Shiftnet, and would-be Disappeared Strength of Distrust)
    - Risk/Wanted System

However, just because that list is large now, doesn't mean I'm not actively working on those features. Double negative aside, feel free to keep up with the development of RED TEAM by following me on Twitter. This link is clickable, by the way. It's not just blue, bold and underlined because I think it looks cool.

Anyway, this concludes the really long scrolling developer message you didn't expect to see. I'll let the game let you create your Agent now. I hope you like what you see so far!
